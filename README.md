# Custom Animated Decal File Renamer
Hello there! 
I am announcing the release of a tool that I made that could be very useful in optimising workflow. 
This tool is called "Animated Decals File Renamer". *Trumpets* **(Hecker yells "Great name!")**

Have you ever wanted to make an animated decal, but your sequence of png images are too long to rename all of them? Then I have the solution for you! This tool was created with the specific purpose of renaming files correctly, almost instantaneously. It is specifically designed to be gui based, so it is simple for anyone to use. 

Please read any important looking information in the gui, and thank you!
