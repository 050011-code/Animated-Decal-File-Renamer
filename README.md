# Custom Animated Decal File Renamer
Hello there! 
This is a tool that I made that could be very useful in optimising workflow. 
This tool is called "Animated Decals File Renamer". *Trumpets* **(Hecker yells "Great name!")**

Have you ever wanted to make an animated decal, but your sequence of png images are too long to rename all of them? Then I have the solution for you! This tool was created with the specific purpose of renaming files correctly, almost instantaneously. It is specifically designed to be gui based, so it is simple for anyone to use. 

It uses the python module os, with ```os.rename``` to change the files, that may give warnings from the exe, but thats what it does, nothing different from the python file or exe

Please read any important looking information in the gui, and thank you!

YOu can download the python file and run it if you have python, or use the compiled exe
